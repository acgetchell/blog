      <description>Causal Dynamical Triangulations computes the path integral of the quantum universe numerically.
To do that you use the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, which is a member of a more general class of algorithms known as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, in particular random walk Monte Carlo methods.
Etc. etc.
Anyways, to have good results, you need to calculate something, in this case perturbations of that universe via &amp;ldquo;ergodic moves&amp;quot;, performed millions of times per simulation, accurately.</description>

      <description>For awhile, I&#39;ve been interested in establishing a secure, verifiable, public identity.
There are any number of reasons to do this, for example, authenticity and non-repudiation, frictionless sharing of files, and so forth. But that&#39;s the topic of another article. What I want to talk about here is how I got to the promised land.
First up is Keybase, which is a really awesome software stack that maps your identity to your public keys.</description>

      <description>A lecture given 10/27/08 by Professor Freeman Dyson of the Institute of Advanced Studies at Princeton, in honor of the 100th anniversary of the founding of the University of California, Davis.
$$E=\left(\frac{c^{2}}{32\pi G}\right)\omega^{2}f^{2}$$ is the energy per gravity wave, where f is the dimensionless amplitude/strain.
$$E_{s}=\frac{\hbar\omega^{4}}{c^{3}}$$ is the energy per graviton, taken from $\hbar\omega$ energy times $\frac{\omega^3}{c^3}$ density
$$f=\left(32\pi\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}\left(L_{p}\frac{\omega}{c}\right)$$ is the strain per graviton.
$$L_{p}=\left(\frac{G\hbar}{c^{3}}\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}=1.4\times10^{-33}cm$$
$$\delta=\left(32\pi\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}L_{p}$$ Gives the linear displacement per graviton.</description>
